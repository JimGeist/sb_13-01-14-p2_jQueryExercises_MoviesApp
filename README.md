## Assignment Details

# Part One ([jQuery DOM Practice repository](https://github.com/JimGeist/sb_13-01-14-p1_jQueryExercises_DOM-Practice/))

Write some jQuery statements to perform some DOM manipulations.


# Part Two 

Build an application that uses jQuery to do the following:
* Contains a form with two inputs for a title and rating along with a button to submit the form.
* When the form is submitted, capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.
* When the button to remove is clicked, remove each title and rating from the DOM.
* Further Study: Ensure that the rating of a movie can only be between 0 and 10.
* Further Study: Ensure that a title has at least 2 characters in it.

(Note: allowing the ability to sort alphabetically by the title of the movie or by the rating of the movie from lowest to highest and vice versa was not implemented).
